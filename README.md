# Tracking GHG Emission in Canada
### Methodology - Multivariate Linear Regression
### Tools - Python Programming language

# Objective
This project involves using Multivariate regression to analyze potential economic contributors to GHG emission in Canada. 

# Scope
The scope of this analysis will cover from 1995 to 2019. The analysis involves the six stages of data analysis; ask, prepare, process, analyse, share and act

The project will include each phases of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act.

# Background Information
Understanding complex relationships between greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and human activities in Canada is crucial. This analysis aims to inform effective policies by exploring the dynamic interactions, identifying key drivers, and assessing regional and temporal variations for targeted emissions reduction strategies.

# Ask
The project aims to inform Canadian policymakers by analyzing historical data (1995-2019) on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Using multivariate regression, it seeks insights into the complex relationship between GHG emissions and human activities, considering spatial and temporal variations for effective policy formulation and emissions reduction strategies.
- A clear statement of the business task
- A description of all data sources used
- Summary of your analysis Supporting visuals and
- key findings Your top three recommendations, based on your analysis

Business Task: 
- Create a base model for analyzing the economic activities impacting GHG emission in Canada,
- then make recommendation to guide policy makers in reducing GHG gas emission .
  
Stakeholders: seun, policy makers and mankind.



# Prepare Phase
The data for this project was sourced from various segments within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) database, which is a reliable and comprehensive source of economic and social statistics for 37 member countries and several partner countries. The data comprises of 12 variables that are related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and human activities in Canada, such as energy consumption, household spending, transportation, industrial production, and trade. The data spans from 1995 to 2019, which covers a period of significant changes and developments in the Canadian economy and society. The data dimension is 25 x 11 (row by column), which means that there are 25 observations (one for each year) and 11 independent variables (excluding the dependent variable, which is GHG emissions).


## Process Phase (see code folder)

## Analyze (see code folder)

# Share Phase
Insights: The model explained 82% of the variation in GHG emissions, which means that it had a high explanatory power and accuracy.

The most important factors that influenced GHG emissions were industrial production, trade, crude oil production, and inflation. These factors had a significant and strong impact on GHG emissions.



### Recommendations: 
The government should use the model to evaluate the potential effects of different policies and scenarios on GHG emissions reduction, and to design effective and efficient strategies to achieve the GHG emissions targets.
The project team should conduct further analysis to compare the model with other models, and to test the validity and robustness of the results. The project team should also consider collecting and analysing primary data, if more time and resources are available.
