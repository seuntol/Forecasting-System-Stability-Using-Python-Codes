# Consumer Behaviour Bike Share Analysis 

# Objective
This project involves using R Studio to deliver on the role assigned to me in determining the behavioural patterns of two categories of users of a bike share service. 

# Scope
The scope of this analysis will cover from May 2022 to June 2023. The analysis involves the six stages of data analysis; ask, prepare, process, analyse, share and act

The project will include each phases of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, act.

# Background Information
The analysis is for Cyclistic a bike share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles. The program has two types of subscribers; the member and the casual subscribers. Riders with annualmemberships are refeered to as members while customers that purchase single ride or full day passes are referred to as casual riders.

Cyclistics financial analyst discovered that annual members are more profitable than casual members and recommends strategizing on how to convert the casual riders into members. My team is tasked to analyze the Cyclistics historical bike trip data to identify trends.

# Ask
Lili Moreno my team lead has assigned to me to use data to analyze how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. I adopted the following report guide in achieving my task:
- A clear statement of the business task
- A description of all data sources used
- Documentation of any cleaning or data manipulation
- Summary of your analysis Supporting visuals and
- key findings Your top three recommendations, based on your analysis

Business Task: 
- define the differences in Cyclstic bike use between casual riders and annual members,
- then recommend marketing strategies aimed at converting those casual riders (single-rider and full-day pass holders) into annual members.
  
Stakeholders: Lily Moreno, Director of Marketing, Cyclistic executive team.

# Prepare Phase
The data has been made available by Motivate International, under license were provided under license. Limitations to the data include: using riders' personally identifiable information, in order to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

Data was downloaded from the AWS server as zip files and saved as .csv files on a local hard drive. The .csv files were then uploaded to Kaggle as a dataset named "cyclistic-historical-data." You may download the data through the link in he Data folder in this repository.

## Process Phase (see code folder)

## Analyze (see code folder)

# Share Phase
Insights: We deduce from the frequency plot that casual subscribers are mostly weekend users reflecting the high rate from Friday to Sunday.

They also have a longer average_duration compared to the member subscriber.

The streeter Dr & Grand Avenue have the most casual users start station while most annual member subscribers start station are at Kingsbury St & Kinzie st.

### Recommendations: 
Based on our findings, I will recommend that a member subscription for weekend users be further investigated for approval. This will encourage casual users to possibly subscribe for this plan.

I will also recommend a membership plan focussed around average long term users. This could be an incentive for average long duration casual users to subscribe for the member plan.

Focus of awareness should be around streeter Dr & Grand Avenue as its the most popular for casual subscribers. Increasing awareness and focussing future strategy in this region has a higher probability of getting more casual subscribers convert to annual members.
